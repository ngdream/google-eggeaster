## Do a barrel roll
Wanna roll a little? Type in Do a barrel roll in the Google search box, and you’ll see the entire webpage rotate clockwise by a full 360 degrees.

## Pacman/Solitaire/ Tic Tac Toe/ Snake

Google sure serves you with the best search results, but it also knows how to show you a good time. You can enjoy some popular arcade games including Pacman, Solitaire, Snake game or Tic Tac Toe, right from the results. You simply need to do a search for any of the aforementioned titles and hit ‘Click to Play’ to immersive yourself in some fun games. This has to be one of my favorite Google Easter Eggs.

## What sound does a cow make?
Google can help either you or your kids learn whatever sound an animal makes, simply by using a search query like, “what sound does a cow make?” or “what sound does a cat make?” You then have to tap the speaker icon next to the animal name to hear the sounds. This is one of the best Google Easter Eggs for kids as it’s not only informative but also cool.

## Error 418 (I’m a teapot)!?

This teapot Easter egg was designed to appease server and SEO enthusiasts and it was supposed to be an April Fools Joke back in 1998. It wasn’t designed for implementation, however, Google still did go ahead with the idea. You can check out the page right here.

## Loneliest number = 1

Well, apart from spewing out numbers in reference to popular works of fiction, Google is also hiding another calculator-based Easter egg under its belt. It refers to “One” as the loneliest number, which could be a reference to Harry Nilson’s popular song under the same name.

## spinner

If you haven’t managed to get over the fidget spinner trend, well, Google intends to be in line with the times. It already displayed a number spinner when you searched for spinner’ but it added a fidget spinner to the same after they gained immense popularity last year.

## bubble level

While many of these Easter eggs work both on the mobile and desktop, Bubble Level is a mobile-only Easter egg which turns your smartphone into exactly what it says – a bubble leveler. You can search for the same and place your smartphone on any surface to tell if its horizontal or vertical.

## metronome

Google is also quite considerate to musicians and has a ‘metronome’ Easter egg available via its search engine. Anytime you want an audible click while writing music or playing an instrument, you can now turn to Google for it.

## Random Number Generator

Google also offers you a random number generator, which can sometimes come in really handy, but that’s not the Easter egg here. The search giant is hip and emojis are cool, so when you set the min and max limits both to 100, you’ll see the 100 emoji. And setting a max limit of more than 10 digits will show you a dizzy face emoji.

##  Super Mario Bros / Sonic the Hedgehog

If you spent your childhood with Super Mario Bros or Sonic the Hedgehog, then you will love this Google Easter egg. When you search for either of the two games, the information card available on the right shows a notable entity from the game. An animated question mark and the signature Mario points sound for the former whereas the Hedgehog rolls into the picture for the latter.


## Atari breakout

Now that we’re on the topic of games, how about playing another one? Called Image Breakout, it’s Google’s take on the classic Breakout arcade game, developed and published years ago by Atari. To access this Easter egg, do a Google image search for the Atari breakout string, and the images in search results will turn into colorful bricks, which you can smash with the ball, while bouncing it off the paddle. If you manage to finish the game, the search automatically redirects to results from any random Image search.


## zerg rush

This Google Easter Egg is especially fun. Search for Zerg rush, and your search results will be attacked from all sides by hordes of O alphabets. The Os can be destroyed by clicking on them repeatedly. The game ends either when all the search results have been destroyed, or when you’ve defeated all the Os. The high score can be shared as well.

## google in 1998

Like pretty much all great things, Google also had humble beginnings, when it started off in 1998. Wanna know how the most popular search engine looked back then? Use Google in 1998 as the search phrase, and go back in time.

## flip coin 

No matter how big or small a dispute is, it can always be sorted out by flipping (or tossing) a coin. And thanks to this Easter egg, you don’t even need to have one in your pocket to toss. Search for Flip a coin, and see whether you get Heads or Tails.
